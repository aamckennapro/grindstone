# grindstone
Grindstone is a web-archive dedicated to my progress as a programmer, tracking languages, frameworks, tools, and other technology I've picked up over time, as well as keeping me engaged with my projects.

## technology
On the backend, grindstone is built upon Node.js on the backend, with React and Tailwind on the frontend. grindstone will frequently link to commits from this account from various repositories, which will keep me up to date 
with what I last accomplished.
